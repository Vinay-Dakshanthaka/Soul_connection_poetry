        <p>Soul Connection welcomes submissions of unpublished poems including translated poems, articles, stories
            including travel and review of poems / poetry releases for publication.</p>

        <p>For sending translation of a poem that is not in the public domain, please identify the rights holder and
            obtain a statement that the rights to publish an English translation are available. Include the original
            text if possible, as well as a short biography of the original poet, and a short introduction of the work.
            If there are extenuating circumstances that prevent you from including a copy of the original text at the
            time of your submission, please note that in the cover letter.</p>

        <p>We publish work by new and upcoming poets as well as that of established poets. All submissions are
            scrutinized by Soul Connection’s editorial board members and are considered on an equal basis. We, however,
            do not offer any individual criticism. Our aim is to accept or reject work within a month, and we do respond
            to every submission – but please read, and follow, the following submission guidelines in order to
            facilitate our response.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Please submit your work only via email: <a
                    href="mailto:editor@soulconnectionne.in">editor@soulconnectionne.in</a></li>
            <li>Kindly send only previously unpublished work. We do not accept work that has been previously published.
                This includes personal blogs and social media.</li>
            <li>Send one submission at a time. That is, please do not send a new submission if you have not yet had a
                response to a previous one.</li>
            <li>We do not consider simultaneous submissions, i.e. work that is being considered elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Poems should be typed and sent in text format (and certainly not in image format).</li>
            <li>Please send your name (only real and no pseudonyms please), address with PIN Code and WhatsApp number
                with the submission.</li>
            <li>Please also send a recent photo of the poet as attachment (jpeg/tiff/png formats).</li>
            <li>Include a cover note with a simple declaration that the submitted content is your original work.</li>
            <li>Submission fees: Nil</li>
            <li>The decision of the editorial board of Soul Connection in matters related to the selection / rejection
                of submissions will be final and binding upon all and no disputes whatsoever will be entertained.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We receive hundreds of poems of which we print only a few. So don’t be discouraged by a rejection from us.
            There are many other online platforms to try.</p>
